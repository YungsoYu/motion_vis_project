# Human Motion Visualizer

### Introduction
This tool is an Open3D-based motion visualizer for the AMASS motion dataset. Alongside animated motion, it visualizes the velocity and acceleration of each joint between frames with arrows on the human model and draws a 2D time series chart of changes in joint angles.
